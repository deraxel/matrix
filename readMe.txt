This program requires the user to add the file *.txt to be added to the execution of the file, matrix.exe
The text file must follow the following format:  a number representing the number of Ix rows and Iy columns in the first matrix, a carriage return, a matrix divided rows by a single space and a carriage return dividing the col. Two data files are required to use gauseelim (which calculates gausing elimination) and LUcalc(which calculates LU decomposition and does gausing elimination to calculate an answer)

.1 .. .Ix  (. represents every number between 1 and x)
